# Charles Gillespie's Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project is to have a place where I can link and display websites like my gitthub, linkedin, and showcase my projects for potential employers to view all in one place. In my portfolio you will find what I am currently studying/learning, what some of my hobbies are, and all of my projects with links to them.
