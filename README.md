# CharlesWGillespie.web

## Description

The purpose of this project is to have a place where I can link and display websites like my gitthub, linkedin, and showcase my projects for potential employers to view all in one place. In my portfolio you will find what I am currently studying/learning, what some of my hobbies are, and all of my projects with links to them.

## Usage

To use this website you will find links to my gitthub and linkedIn with anchor-links to "About Me" section describing things I like to do and hobbies, and "Contact Informaiton" with my demo email and demo phone number. Near the bottom of the page you will also find what languages and tools I am currently learning/studying and a "Projects" section with images and links to all projects I have built. (Please Note: If a project image does not have a link, I have not completed it yet.)
